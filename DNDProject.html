                <p>The Lion Ti cult worship "the old ways," choosing to focus on nature instead of the gods. They
                    believe that magic of nature origins is the only "true" magic, and any other systems are shunned as
                    being impure. They share their druidic knowledge with no one. Outsiders are considered corrupt and
                    wicked. </p>

                <h2>The Council</h2>
                <p>Lion Ti is ruled by a group of six elders, holding five seats on the Council. The council members use
                    smokeweed for vision quests, and then use what they see on these quests to shape the future of the
                    cult. Although the council votes on all choices, the eldest Elder has the most influence.</p>
                <h3>Inside the Elder's Hut</h3>
                <p>The hut is more of a druidic manor house. A giant tree stands in the middle of the room, growing out
                    of the roof. The roots create five levels of grassy plateaus where each throne is set. The walls are
                    lined by hieroglyphics that flow softly in the dark light. In the center of the room is a fire that
                    never dies, around which the Elders sit during their vision quests. The roof and walls are all made
                    of vines, thorns, and ivy twisting through the brick.</p>

                <p>The cult celebrates upon death. Funerals are the equivalent of a birthday party, meant to celebrate
                    the dead member's moving on to the next stage of life. Death is not the end for Lion Ti, and instead
                    is a simple part of the life cycle. Members are rewarded in death by sharing their energy with the
                    earth and becoming part of nature.</p>

                                <li>Is the kindest of the Elders and is growing tired the others. He doesn’t believe
                                    what they do is right, but tries to hold his own believing he can change things for
                                    the best for his family.</li>

                                    think for themselves and worship nature with love instead of hatred.</li>

                                <li>She wanted to become a healer in order to help save others from the plague, after
                                    losing
                                    her parents to the plague at the age of thirteen.</li>
                                <li>She’s seen as an outsider in the community, and still lives with her father.</li>

                                <li>Because of her outsider status, she is not privy to many of the cult secrets that
